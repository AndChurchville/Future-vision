# Future Vision
Future Vision is an app for social workers who are required to visit multiple clients every three months. 
After a user enters in their client's name and the last time they visited, the app determines and reminds the user the next available visit date. My goal for Future Vision is to solve the problem of managing many clients and provide organization. 
The idea came from having a conversation with my cousin who works as a care co-coordinator and visits many clients in the Memphis area.
